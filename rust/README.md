# Opencast kata template for Rust

## What does this provide?

- A simple Rust project that's setup with `cargo`
- The testing using `cargo`

## Using this template

### Prerequisite requirements

- Rust and cargo. You'll need (rustup)[https://rustup.rs/] to build this one.

### Coding and running

- When running commands - ensure that this folder (`rust/`) is your working directory
- When coding in IDE - open this folder (`rust/`) in the IDE not the parent folder, otherwise tools may not be able to give code hints or run formatters

### Key commands

- `cargo test` - runs the Rust compiler on source files, then compiles tests files, then FINALLY it runs the tests
