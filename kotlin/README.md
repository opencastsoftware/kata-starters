## What does this provide?

- A simple Kotlin project that's set up with gradle as the build tool
- Testing using JUnit 5

## Using this template

### Prerequisite requirements

A Java 8+ JDK and gradle.

### Coding and running

- When running commands - ensure that this folder (`kotlin/`) is your working directory
- When coding in IDE - open this folder (`kotlin/`) in the IDE not the parent folder, otherwise tools like `IntelliJ` may not be able to give code hints or run formatters

### Key commands

- `./gradlew compile` - compile the project.
- `./gradlew test` - runs JUnit tests.
