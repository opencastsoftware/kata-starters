# Opencast kata template for Typescript

## What does this provide?

- A TypeScript project that's set up with `npm` and `esbuild`
- The package manager is `npm`
- The test runner is `jest`

## Using this template

### Prerequisite requirements

You'll need to have `node` installed and `npm`.

### Coding and running

- When running commands - ensure that this folder (`typescript/`) is your working directory
- When coding in IDE - open this folder (`typescript/`) in the IDE not the parent folder, otherwise tools may not be able to give code hints or run formatters

### Key commands

- `npm test` - will run all your tests.
- `npm run build` - will typecheck the code.
- `npm run bundle` - will bundle the code into `./dist/esbuild`.
- `npm run lint` - will lint the code with `eslint`.
- `npm run doc` - will build documentation pages using `typedoc`.
