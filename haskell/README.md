# Opencast kata template for Haskell

## Using this template

- When running commands - ensure that this folder (`haskell/`) is your working directory
- When coding in IDE - open this folder (`haskell/`) in the IDE not the parent folder, otherwise tools may not be able to give code hints or run formatters

## What does this provide?

- A simple Haskell project that's setup with GHC & cabal as the build tool.
- The testing framework used is Haskell Test
- Spec autodiscovery is possible but it requires installing things globally with cabal for it to work with haskell-language-server

## Key commands

- ???
